## 8. Technical Architecture  
- **Smart Contract:** Standard ERC-20 on Avalanche C-Chain with mint, burn, and buyback functions.  
- **Ownership & Security:** Managed by a 2-of-3 Gnosis Safe multisig with a 48-hour timelock module.  
- **Bridges & Multi-Chain Reserve:** Zero-mint IVC contracts deployed (but no initial supply) on Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Arbitrum to lock the ticker.  
- **Loyalty Portal:** React/Node.js front-end connecting via web3.js to Avalanche-compatible wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect).  
- **Explorer Verification:** Verified contract on SnowTrace (Avalanche’s Etherscan clone) to establish official provenance.

## 11. Conclusion  
InnVest Coin bridges real-world travel with on-chain ownership. By launching on Avalanche for low-fee, high-throughput transactions and locking the IVC ticker across chains, we ensure both scalability and brand security. Token holders will own a direct stake in our “Getaway” motel ecosystem and share in its long-term growth.
